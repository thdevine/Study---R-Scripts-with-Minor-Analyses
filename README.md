# Studying/R Scripts/Minor Analyses
  - DISCLAIMER: I've added things that are from personal notes, so most of what I have written at the time this repo was made are things I already studied---this is a needed disclaimer since I made my GitHub around the time I started job-hunting to showcase past and present work.

This repo will be for my own personal studying. However, it may be useful for others.

This repo is especially for revisiting subjects/papers/books/research materials I found while reading or working on projects but I didn't want to distract myself from my (then) current work. Some of these things I've since become familiar with and use---while others I've not. 

This might seem like a weird way to keep my learning public, but it's a fun way to let other know what I've thought was interesting or spent my time learning.

  ## Code (most interview questions relate to pulls/reads ['read' in the archetypal acronym "CRUD":=Create Read Update Delete])
  -Interview_SQL_queries.sql contains a small selection of queries I've coded as solutions to questions seen on Interview Query. 
  ## Book/Reading
  - Data Analysis using SQL and Excel by Gordon S. Linoff (Top 0.01% sql/mysql/sql server contributor on STACKOVERFLOW, see https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff). Since most questions you google will lead, with very high probability, lead to a comment he made it makes sense to consider his work as a primary source of learning
  - SQL cookbook by Molinaro and de Graaf (SQLite)
